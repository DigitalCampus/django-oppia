Quality Assurance Process & Checklist
=======================================

Quality assurance (QA) is an important part of ensuring that code releases are
tested correctly before being handed over, or new app releases being put up on 
Google Play.

Automated tests can go a long way, but some areas still need manual testing, 
especially before we have much wider code coverage.

Before an app release is handed over, the `QA checklist template <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EVUIzAIbM_efK4SYq2gF1uxTK9LclyB9pcgJaXxQXQ0>`_ 
will be completed, and 

Workflow:

#. Create a copy of the QA checklist, with filename in the format: 
   <app>-<version>-<date> and place this in the same folder on Google Drive as 
   the apk file. 
#. Assign the testing tasks to individuals - ideally there would be a different
   set of people who are doing the tests to those who worked on the coding.
#. Once all the tests have been completed, and are passing, the code can be 
   released/handed over.
